<hr/>

    <h3>1. Harry Potter</h3>
        <p>This is where i learn that extraordinary life needs extraordinary sacrifices. I also find my crushes haha. She's the one and only Hermonie Granger</p>
    <h3>2. One Piece</h3>
        <p>I've just realized that the life worth to live because we don't know the end, so we can write our end. <br>
            That's why i really admire a dreamer and also a doer that brave enough to pursue despite all the odds. Even the world against you.</p>
    <h3>3. The Fast and Furious Saga</h3>
        <p>No need explanation. As a petrolhead, this is a must watch saga. So sad when Paul Walker die the way he does. I don't know how many times i rewatch the entire saga haha.</p>
